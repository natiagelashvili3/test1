      "subTitle": "To transcend blockchain technology, with the goal to lead the way in blockchain mass-adoption, by addressing the obstacles that current blockchain solutions face - namely the scalability, interoperability, security and usability of blockchain technology.",
      "text": "One of the major approaches to overcome the performance and scalability limitations of current blockchain protocols is to use true sharding, which is to split the overhead of processing transactions among multiple, smaller groups of nodes. In parallel, these groups work to optimize performance while requiring substantially smaller communication, computing, and storage per node, enabling the device to scale to large networks. Hypercube is powered by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning principles at the core of its blockchain- its consensus, together with side chains and off-chain transaction processing to enable both the acceleration of block broadcasting to the chain and scaling out through asynchronous consensus zones.\n\nHypercube overcomes the security concerns associated with blockchain technology, such as 51% attacks and vendor exploits, by combing secure multi-party computation and attribute-based encryption, together with other security practices such as committee reconfiguration and zero knowledge proof. These proven security practices enable anyone to transact freely and securely in the Hypercube ecosystem.\n\nA lot of research is being done into creating true cross-chain communication between the various blockchains. Hypercube has combined some of these solutions to create one hybrid cross-chain communication protocol. This hybrid solution makes use of hash-locking, notary schemes, and blockchain bridges, together with trusted relays, side chains, and blockchain migrators. Thus, creating an advanced solution that allows the Hypercube blockchain to become the internet of blockchains.\n\nOur blockchain ecosystem incorporates a combination of public blockchain sharding, an optimal AI powered consensus, as well as a cross-chain and cross-shard communication protocol into a hybrid solution that is not only Byzantine fault, but also has very high throughputs through block pipelining."
